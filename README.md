======

Written in a mixture of IDL, C, Python and LaTeX, this custom analytics software delivers
'schedule files' to remotely control a balloon-borne telescope, simulates their pointing
and sky coverage, and automatically generates PDF documentation ('documentation driven design')
for visualising and assessing the scanning strategy. I wrote this software in order to enable the
redesign the EBEX scanning strategy into the most efficient survey pattern conforming to Antarctic
observing constraints.

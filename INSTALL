Installing and running the hexsky package
-----------------------------------------
S. Leach (leach@sissa.it)

1) Required packages:

 - GetData version 0.7.3 or greater- the dirfile library available from:
   http://getdata.sourceforge.net/
   or download the source code directly from:
   http://people.sissa.it/~leach/libs/getdata-0.7.3.tar.bz2

   This is used to write pointing from the hexsky C code.

 - IDL is required for the overall parsing, simulation and documentation,
   of schedule files.

 - The IDL codes will make use of Latex, ImageMagick 'convert', Python (numpy),
   and dvipdf.

2) Environment flags:

  Put these modified environment flags in your ~/.bashrc file:

 export HEXSKY=/path/to/hexsky
 export ARCH=machinename

  and then run 'source ~/.bashrc' to update settings.

  The HEXSKY environment flag is needed by IDL to locate procedures,
  data and the hexsky binary.
  
  The ARCH environment (architecture name: choose something like
  "mylaptopname") is used in hexsky/src/Makefile for determining the
  compile and link flags for the hexsky binary.

3) IDL startup file:
  
  Put the following lines in your IDL startup file (eg. in
  Healpix_2.1X/src/idl/HEALPix_startup)

 hexskyroot = getenv('HEXSKY')
 DEFSYSV, '!path_sep', ':'
 !path      = expand_path('+'+hexskyroot)+!path_sep+!path
 hexskylib     

 This adds the hexsky/pro IDL procedures to the IDL path and
 initialises the library by running hexskylib.pro.

4) Compilation of hexsky binary:

 Once the ARCH environment flag has been set, go to hexsky/src, modify
 the Makefile and compile the C scanning code (bin/hexsky):
 
 make hexsky

 This will prodice the binary file hexsky/bin/hexsky

5) Download Healpix map templates and other data:

  cd data/
  bash getdata.sh

6) Running the test driver (pro/hexsky/hexsky_test_driver.pro):

 Start HIDL (Healpix IDL)

 HIDL> hexsky_example

 The above example simulates a pre-defined schedule file.

 HIDL> strategy_example

 The above example generates some schedule files and then simulates them.


 This will produce a number of outputs in the directory called
 output_hexsky/ not limited to the following:

 - Documentation: scanning_doc*.pdf
 - Pointing dirfile: dirfile/. The entries RA, DEC and BETA
   give the boresight pointing and orientation.
 - hexsky parameter files: hexsky*.par at slow and full sample rates
   (set in the mission file), for convenience. These parameter files
   can be used to reproduce the pointing dirfile without using IDL.
 - ps/ directory containg postscript images used in the documentation.
 - Integration time Healpix map: tint*fits.
 - Sky visibility Healpix map: Show what part of the sky is available,
   and for how long (in hours per day) during the 24 hour period at
   the start of the schedule.
